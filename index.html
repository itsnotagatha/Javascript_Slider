        <h2>Introduction to Computer Games</h2>
        <p>Personal computer games (PC games) are the games played on a computer using interface devices such as keyboard and mouse, a joystick/gamepad. Additionally sound may be provided through speakers or headphones.
          <br><br>The term computer game shouldn't be messed with video games, console games and arcade games. Video games and console games are usually connected to a TV, while arcade games are available in public spaces. At the outset, games were played at an arcade have envolved to be PC games played at home.

        <h2>History of Computer Games</h2>
        <p>Computer games have grown and changed over time, developing from simple shoot-them-up games to sophisticated and nearly ubiquitous works of art.
          <br><br>General assumption is that first computer game was Tic-tac-toe which was created in 1952. But "Spacewar" was the first game intended for computer use which was invented in 1962. In 1974, Atari Company developed, "Pong", which allowed playing tennis on your television. The first strategy game was "Empire". Later, scope and complexity of war games were
          enhanced. <br><br>With that war games increased in popularity, the speed and the user friendliness made computer games popular. In 1977 Apple released the Apple II which popularized the general-purpose computer as a gaming platform.
          From 1989 the Internet was opened to the public at large. In 1991, Tim  Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web and as a result the Internet became easier for the users. Internet made online computer gaming more popular.

        <h2>Computer game development</h2>
        <p>The majority of computer game developers are independent companies although a large number of publishers also have in-house development teams, or own equity in external developers.
          <br>Developers occupy Programmers, Artists, Musicians, Sound Engineers,  Designers, Producers and administrative staff to work on the development of the games.</p>

        <h2>pt.2 Process Design</h2>
        <p>The making of a game starts with the design. The design team creates a design document for the game, which includes all its features in detail, the audio
        style, visual styles, and the approach for programming.
        <br>The design will be reviewed a number of times by design team as well as by other interested parties before planning of the next stage.</p>

        <h2>pt.3 Research</h2>
        <p>The design team identifies areas that may cause problems and carry out research to decide how certain tasks will be accomplished, graphics, layout /structure for the code and its associated data etc. At the end of the research phase the various items of prototype code/art/sound will be reviewed.</p>

        <h2>pt.4 Development</h2>
        <p>The full design will be handed over to the development team. It creates task lists and a development schedule. These two documents, along with the design, will be reviewed and updated as the development process proceeds. Based upon the research from the previous phase the team will start developing the computer code, the tools that will be used to assemble it; plus the art, sound and music. First a working prototype will be developed to test the design concepts.</p>

        <h2>pt.5 Implementation</h2>
        <p>After development phase project moves into the implementation phase. The various assets must be assembled to create the complete game. Testing and game play adjustment continues throughout this phase and emphasis shifts from creativity to productivity. By this point decisions should have been made and all concepts tested.</p>

        <h2>pt.5 Testing and Mods</h2>
        <p>The quality of the game play and possible bugs are tested. Outside testers and members of focus groups are used to evaluate the difficulties, controls, learning curve and other key features of game play<br>Mods mean the modifications to a game made by the users or developers, using original release of a game.</p>

        <h2>Types of computer games</h2>
        <p>There are four types of computer games:
          <ul>
            <li>Strategic games (need to be played with caution and patience)</li>
            <li>First person shooters (game gives a unique feeling like you are inside the game)</li>
            <li>3rd person viewed games (view from an observer's point of view)</li>
            <li>Racing games (Options of changing the view of the game)</li>
          </ul></p>

        <h2>Computer Gaming Technology</h2>
        <p>There are five types of computer games technology:
          <ul>
            <li>Hardware</li>
            <li>Software</li>
            <li>Local area networking gaming</li>
            <li>Online games</li>

        <h2>Future of computer gaming</h2>
        <p>Realism is a major objective of game developers. In the near future, computer-controlled non-player characters (NPCs) will be smarter and more human- like in their behavior. We can predict that NPCs will also have artificial intelligence. There will be no need to program NCPs how to behave. They will take independent decisions like the player. <br><br>Human sensory experience has 5 senses. Future developments will be able to stimulate more of these senses such as pain and taste in addition to sight and hearing, which we have now. Future Games will allow player to feel the virtual environment.</p>

        <h2>Social aspects of Computer gaming</h2>
        <p>With the popularity of Computer games, the social, health and economic consequences of playing them have become a concern. One argument is that it leads to unhealthy life styles, waste of time and economic resources and violent, aggressive and antisocial behavior and they have been seen as negatively affecting the players in terms of lack of social skills, inefficiency, obesity and laziness. <br><br>Another view is that it provides relaxation and skills while digital game-based learning enhances student engagement. Such as involves in problem solving, planning, estimation and analysis of the moves or actions of opponent. This affects the player positively by developing in him/her problem-solving skills, analytical and estimation skills and quick decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The evolution of computer games had been very fast, also the popularity and the number of users have also increased dramatically. The scope and complexities of games have expanded and the devices have been improved to accommodate such requirements. <br><br>Nowadays computer game developing has become a large industry. In developing computer games there should be not only programmer's effort, programmers have to work with Artists, Musicians, Sound Engineers, Designers, Producers in order to build a better computer game.</p>
